# JackKnife
JackKnife is a Network Defense Tool Repository for Powershell. It contains multiple Powershell Scripts that I've made and or borrowed. Anything I've borrowed will be cited and given credit to the original owners. JackKnife is in a revamp stage and most old modules/scripts will be replaced with newer and better working scripts.
